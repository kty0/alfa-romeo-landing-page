1. **Clone the repository:**

## Configuration

- **Modifying the Email Address:**

  In the `App.jsx` file, on line 9, there is a variable `em` that represents the email address where the collected data will be sent. Modify this variable to your own email address to receive the data collected from the form submissions.

  ```jsx
  const em = "your-email@example.com";
